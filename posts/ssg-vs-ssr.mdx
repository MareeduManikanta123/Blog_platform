# Understanding Static Site Generation vs Server-Side Rendering

When building web applications, choosing the right rendering strategy is crucial for performance and user experience. Let's explore SSG and SSR in detail.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

SSG generates HTML pages at **build time**. This means:
- Pages are pre-rendered during the build process
- Extremely fast page loads (< 100ms)
- Perfect for content-heavy sites like blogs
- SEO-friendly out of the box

### SSG Example

```typescript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const posts = await getPosts();
  return {
    props: { posts },
    revalidate: 3600, // Revalidate every hour
  };
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getPosts();
  return {
    paths: posts.map(post => ({ params: { slug: post.slug } })),
    fallback: 'blocking',
  };
}
```

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

SSR generates pages on each request. This means:
- Pages are generated when a user requests them
- Better for dynamic content
- Slightly slower initial load times
- Always fresh content

### SSR Example

```typescript
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const data = await fetchData();
  return { props: { data } };
}
```

## Choosing Between SSG and SSR

| Feature | SSG | SSR |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Build Time | Longer | Shorter |
| Page Load Speed | Fastest | Slower |
| Content Freshness | Revalidation needed | Always fresh |
| Best For | Blogs, Documentation | Dynamic content |
| Cost | Lower (CDN) | Higher (servers) |

## Best Practices

1. **Use SSG for content that doesn't change frequently** - blogs, documentation
2. **Use SSR for real-time data** - user dashboards, personalized content
3. **Use Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** - the best of both worlds
4. **Combine both strategies** - use SSG for most pages and SSR where needed

## Conclusion

Both SSG and SSR have their place in modern web development. By understanding when to use each, you can build lightning-fast, user-friendly applications that scale efficiently.
