# Docker and Containerization for Web Developers

Docker has become an essential tool in modern web development. It solves the "works on my machine" problem by containerizing your entire application environment.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that packages your application, dependencies, and configuration into a single unit called a **container**. This ensures your app runs the same everywhere.

## Why Use Docker?

1. **Consistency**: Same environment across development, testing, and production
2. **Isolation**: Dependencies don't conflict with other projects
3. **Scalability**: Easy to deploy multiple instances
4. **Version Control**: Track changes to your application environment
5. **Collaboration**: Team members work with identical setups

## Basic Docker Concepts

### Images
A Docker image is a blueprint for creating containers. It contains:
- Base operating system
- Application code
- Dependencies
- Environment variables

### Containers
A container is a running instance of an image. It's lightweight and fast.

## Creating a Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use Node.js as the base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container applications.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production

  database:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db_data:
```

## Common Docker Commands

```bash
# Build an image
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .

# Run a container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app:1.0

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop container_id

# View logs
docker logs container_id

# Execute command in container
docker exec -it container_id bash
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use specific base image tags** - Not `latest`
2. **Minimize layer size** - Each command creates a layer
3. **Use multi-stage builds** - For smaller production images
4. **Don't run as root** - For security
5. **Use .dockerignore** - Similar to .gitignore

## Conclusion

Docker has revolutionized how developers build and deploy applications. Mastering it is essential for modern web development.
